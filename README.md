# NinaRow
## Getting started
Just clone the repo and run `org.flipdot.ninarow.tests.TestAllPlayers`. It will let play every type of player against every other type 1000 times and prints the results.

## Create your own player
Implement `org.flipdot.ninarow.core.Player` as `in org.flipdot.ninarow.player.RandomPlayer`.
